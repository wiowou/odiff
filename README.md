# ODiff 

## A utility inspired by [deep-object-diff](https://github.com/mattphillips/deep-object-diff) that leverages the Functional Programming (FP) library [Ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda)

### Objectives for writing ODiff

- Learn more about functional programming using JavaScript/TypeScript
- Test - in an admittedly unscientific manner - some assumptions I've come across regarding FP
- Convey some impressions of FP by one new to it

### TL;DR

## Conclusions pertaining to this project only

### Assumption: FP dramatically reduces the testing burden

### Assumption: FP code is more terse (less boilerplate)

### Assumption: FP code is more intuitive to read

### Assumption: FP code is more intuitive to write

### Drawbacks of using the FP approach

## General Impressions and Reflections

## Inferences that could be made to other projects

## Further areas for study
